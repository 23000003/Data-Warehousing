## New Topic:

**Our Aim:** <br/>
1. **Update collision trends**
  - There exists the 2015-2019 collision trends
  - We want to update this to 2020 - 2024 collision trends
<br/>

2. **Gather Vision Zero Installation Data**
  - alongside the update we want to gather data regarding the installations in relation to the vision zero project
  - the data gathered will range from 2019 - 2022 (or 2019 -  JAN2023/JUN2023)
<br/>

**What we Query/Do:** <br/>
1. **See the correlation between the VZI Data and the updated collision trends**
  - with the Vision Zero Installation Data and the 2020 - 2024 Collision Trends Data gathered
  - we want to see if there are any improvements at all
  - THE COMPARISON WILL BE DONE WITH THE ALREADY COMPLETED INSTALLATIONS 
  - This will be done in the form of a heat map
