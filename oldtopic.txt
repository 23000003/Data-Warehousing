### Title:
-- Determining the effectiveness of the Vision Zero Plan (2015-2019)
-- and Providing Updated Data for 2019 - 2024

**We are comparing the existing data which is 2015-2019 made by the county and we are giving them the updated version which is from 2019-2024**

**tldr** 
1. talks about the future plans of the county to prevent and mitigate road incidents
2. program officially started in 2017
3. data comparisons from 2015 to 2019
4. shows a lot of heat maps and graphs regarding the crashes 

**Our aim**
1. Basically provide an updated version of the pdf (2019 - 2024)
2. Data will start from 2019 - 2024
3. Comparing 2015-2019 of their installations to 2019-2024 if that "cause" lessened the incidents of the county 
4. Determining new cause (majority) of the accidents, giving detailed analysis
5. Comparing accident causes between the existing data (2015-2019) to updated data (2019 - 2024)

**what we want to know and what to do**

1. determine if there any improvements
2. find out the constructions, installations, and etc. that the county has   made in relation to the program (segregate into year)
3. plot these findings on a map
4. generate heat maps of the crashes that occurred on the county (segregate into year)
5. overlap these two by year and see if there are any improvements (ie if zone 1 was red in 2019 

but improvements have been made by each incrementing year which results in zone 1 being less red)
